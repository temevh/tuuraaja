# Tuuraaja
Tuuraaja is a full-stack app made to make it easier for schools to find and contact substitutes on a short notice. The substitute candidates select the days on which they are available and what subjects they are able to teach. The secretary/teacher looking for a substitute can then easily fetch all of the potential candidates from the database and send them an email or an sms, either to everyone at once or one at a time.

## note: the project is still very much in progress
